This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## My Readme
In a Next.js application, the file structure shown in your image is based on the App Router introduced in Next.js 13, which allows you to organize your application into directories containing page.tsx, layout.tsx, and other files.

Here's a breakdown of how your file structure works and what runs in which order:

Key Files
layout.tsx

A layout file defines a shared structure or design for a specific route or set of routes.
It wraps around all the pages in its directory and its subdirectories.
Layouts are rendered first and are persistent across route changes (they don't re-render unless they explicitly depend on dynamic content).
Example Use Case: A navigation bar or sidebar that is constant across multiple pages.
page.tsx

A page file defines the main content for a specific route.
It is rendered within the layout.tsx file.
A page.tsx file is required to define a route in Next.js.
Example Use Case: A specific page like "Credits," "Profile," or "Transformation" that displays unique content for that route.
How Your Structure Works
Top-Level Directory:
app/: This is the root of your application. It uses the App Router.
Nested Routes:
app/(auth)/layout.tsx:

Acts as the layout for the routes in the (auth) group, such as login or signup pages.
The layout.tsx here will render first, wrapping all subpages like /auth/credits, /auth/profile, etc.
app/(auth)/page.tsx:

Represents the root page of the (auth) route, accessible at /auth.
Its content is displayed within the (auth)/layout.tsx.
app/(root)/layout.tsx:

Acts as the layout for the root-level routes (credits, profile, transformation).
This layout is persistent across navigation in the /credits, /profile, and /transformation pages.
app/(root)/credits/page.tsx:

Represents the /credits route.
Rendered within the (root)/layout.tsx.
app/(root)/profile/page.tsx:

Represents the /profile route.
Rendered within the (root)/layout.tsx.
Render Order
When you navigate to a route (e.g., /credits), Next.js processes the files in this order:

layout.tsx:

The nearest parent layout.tsx file (in this case, app/(root)/layout.tsx) is rendered first.
This ensures the shared layout (e.g., navigation, sidebar) is in place.
page.tsx:

The specific page.tsx file for the route (e.g., app/(root)/credits/page.tsx) is rendered inside the layout.
Globals
globals.css:
Applies global styles across the entire application.
Typically imported in the root layout.tsx or _app.tsx.
Dynamic Rendering
Layouts and pages can also:

Use static rendering (default for non-dynamic data).
Use server-side rendering (via getServerSideProps or React Server Components).
Use client-side rendering (with dynamic or interactive components).
